                         An upper bound on a region of the sky that can 
                         be covered by returned images.  That is, no image
                         returned by this service will cover more than 
                         this limit.  Not providing this element or 
                         specifying a value of 360 degrees indicates that 
                         there is no fundamental limit to the region covered 
                         by a returned image.  
                      
                         When the imageServiceType is “Cutout” or “Mosaic”, 
                         this represents the largest area that can be requested.
                         In this case, the “no limit” value means that all-sky
                         images can be requested.  When the type is “Atlas” or
                         “Pointed”, it should be a region that most closely 
                         encloses largest images in the archive, and the ”no
                         limit” value means that the archive contains all-sky

                         A measure of the largest image the service
                         can produce given as the maximum number of
                         pixels along the first or second axes.
                         Not providing a value indicates that there is 
                         no effective limit to the size of the images 
                         that can be returned.  
                      
                         This is primarily relevant when the imageServiceType
                         is “Cutout” or “Mosaic”, indicating the largest 
                         image that can be created.  When the imageServiceType

                         be searched for but not returned because they are

                         number.  This number will then represent a

                        greater than the number of images available in the

enum ImageServiceType  "
       The class of image service: Cutout, Mosaic, Atlas, Pointed
         "
{
Cutout  "
         This is a service which extracts or “cuts out” rectangular
         regions of some larger image, returning an image of the
         requested size to the client. Such images are usually drawn
         from a database or a collection of survey images that cover
         some large portion of the sky. To be considered a cutout
         service, the returned image should closely approximate (or at
         least not exceed) the size of the requested region; however,
         a cutout service will not normally resample (rescale or
         reproject) the pixel data. A cutout service may mosaic image
         segments to cover a large region but is still considered a
         cutout service if it does not resample the data.  Image
         cutout services are fast and avoid image degredation due to
         resampling.  
               ",
Mosaic  "
                  This service is similar to the image cutout service
                  but adds the capability to compute an image of the
                  size, scale, and projection specified by the
                  client. Mosaic services include services which
                  resample and reproject existing image data, as well
                  as services which generate pixels from some more
                  fundamental dataset, e.g., a high energy event list
                  or a radio astronomy measurement set. Image mosaics
                  can be expensive to generate for large regions but
                  they make it easier for the client to overlay image
                  data from different sources. Image mosaicing
                  services which resample already pixelated data will
                  degrade the data slightly, unlike the simpler cutout
                  service which returns the data unchanged.  
               ",
Atlas  "
                  This category of service provides access to
                  pre-computed images that make up a survey of some
                  large portion of the sky. The service, however, is
                  not capable of dynamically cutting out requested
                  regions, and the size of atlas images is
                  predetermined by the survey. Atlas images may range
                  in size from small cutouts of extended objects to
                  large calibrated survey data frames. 
               ",
Pointed  "
                  This category of service provides access to
                  collections of images of many small, “pointed”
                  regions of the sky. “Pointed” images normally focus
                  on specific sources in the sky as opposed to being
                  part of a sky survey. This type of service usually
                  applies to instrumental archives from observatories
                  with guest observer programs (e.g., the HST archive)
                  and other general purpose image archives (e.g., the
                  ADIL). If a service provides access to both survey
                  and pointed images, then it should be considered a
                  Pointed Image Archive for the purposes of this
                  specification; if a differentiation between the
                  types of data is desired the pointed and survey data
                  collections should be registered as separate image
                  services.
