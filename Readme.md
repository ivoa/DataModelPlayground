Data Model Playground
=====================

This repository does not contain the "official versions" of the data models, 
but gathers them together to make it easy to experiment with various 
refactorings.

It uses the [vodml tools](https://github.com/ivoa/vo-dml/blob/master/tools/ReadMe.md) and has the original source for the models as [vodsl](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/Notes/VODSL/index.html) in the [models](./models) directory.
